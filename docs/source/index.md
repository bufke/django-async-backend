```

Django's `a`-prefixed ORM methods (`aget`, `acreate`, …) are thin
`sync_to_async` wrappers: the query still runs on a threadpool, on a
synchronous connection. **django-async-backend** replaces the database layer
itself, so queries are issued on a real asyncio connection through
{pypi}`psycopg` 3, with async transactions, async cursors and optional
connection pooling.

The project is **production ready**: the API is stable, and each release is
pinned to the Django feature release it was generated against, so upgrades stay
predictable.

```{warning}
**Run this under ASGI.** django-async-backend is developed for ASGI, and that
is the only mode it is supported in. Under WSGI — including the Django
development server — it behaves inconsistently, because WSGI creates a new
event loop for each request and the async connection state cannot be managed
reliably across them. Connection pooling in particular is not supported there.
```

## Feature Summary

- Database layer
  - [Connection handler](connections.md#connection-handler)
  - [Cursors](connections.md#cursors)
  - [Connection pooling](connections.md#connection-pooling)
  - [Request signals](setup.md#request-signals)
- ORM
  - [`AsyncModelMixin`](orm.md#asyncmodelmixin) — `async_save()` / `async_delete()`
  - [Managers](orm.md#managers) — the `async_objects` manager
  - [Compatibility matrix](orm.md#compatibility)
- Transactions
  - [Basic usage](transactions.md#basic-usage)
  - [Nested transactions (savepoints)](transactions.md#nested-transactions-savepoints)
  - [`on_commit` callbacks](transactions.md#using-on_commit-with-async-transactions)
- Testing
  - [`AsyncioTestCase`](testing.md#asynciotestcase)
  - [`AsyncioTransactionTestCase`](testing.md#asynciotransactiontestcase)
- Implementation details
  - [Concurrency and parallelism](concurrency.md)
  - [Running queries in parallel](concurrency.md#running-queries-in-parallel)

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-async-backend[binary]
```

The `binary` extra installs the C-accelerated {pypi}`psycopg` implementation.
Without it you get the pure-Python implementation, which is noticeably slower.
If you use connection pooling, add the `pool` extra as well:

```bash
pip install django-async-backend[binary,pool]
```

The package tracks Django's major and minor version, so the release you install
is pinned to the Django feature release it was generated against.

| django-async-backend | Django  |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| `6.1.3`              | `6.1.0` |

Part of the ORM layer is generated from Django's own source *ahead of time*:
the generated modules are committed to git and shipped in the wheel, so nothing
is downloaded or rewritten at install time and nothing is patched at runtime. A
Django feature release therefore gets a matching django-async-backend feature
release rather than a loosened version range. See
[Code generation](contribute.md#code-generation).

        "PASSWORD": "postgres",
        "HOST": "localhost",

    },
}

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "django_async_backend",
